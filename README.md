# DoggoGAN
GAN 4 doggos &lt;3

Hello there, this repo contains the code my team and I use for the kaggle competition : [Generative Dog Images](https://www.kaggle.com/c/generative-dog-images/overview/description)

This is a WGAN (Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network) for dog image generation in TensorFlow. It is an adaptation of Siraj code [pokeGAN](https://github.com/llSourcell/Pokemon_GAN) (all the credit goes to him, go subscribe to his [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A), it's great)

Coming soon (or not) tensorboard features, weights, generated images of dogs (yeah \o/), a notebook with maths, pics and charts

Wanna run something ? Please download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/generative-dog-images/data) (you might need to join the competition to do so).
 Then, to train the model simply type : `python doggoGAN.py`

I suggest you to train it on a GPU since it might take a while otherwise

XOXO
